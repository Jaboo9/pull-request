# Exercise: Rebase

* Create a new branch called `blue-rebase`.
* Using that branch, create one commit for each of these files with any contents:
  * `s.md`
  * `t.md`
  * `u.md`
* Open a pull request proposing changes from `blue-rebase` branch to `master`.
* Merge that pull request using the rebase merge option.
* Questions
  * What happened to each of the commits that introduced those files in the compare branch?
  * Check out this repo's Insights Tab's Network Tab. What does this visual say about the `blue-rebase` branch to the `master` branch?
  * Find the documentation for this method in GitHub Help. Does the description match what you saw?
* Prepare to share what you did, what you learned, and any outstanding questions you have with the group.
